                    <br />
                    India is taking bold steps to enhance investments in its manufacturing
                    sector, transitioning from a service-oriented market to a
                    manufacturing hub. The government’s emphasis on boosting industrial
                    development through accelerated industrial corridors is expected to
                    significantly boost the demand for industrial fluids. As the
                    manufacturing base expands, sectors such as power and energy, mining
                    and metals, textiles, and cement are experiencing strong growth.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Consequently, our industrial segment achieved double-digit growth in
                    FY24, supported by new business development initiatives. The growing
                    industrial segment will drive consumption of industrial and hydraulic
                    fluids, cutting oil, metal working fluids, greases, and other
                    industrial oils.
