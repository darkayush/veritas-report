          India is taking bold steps to enhance investments in its manufacturing
          sector, transitioning from a service-oriented market to a
          manufacturing hub. The government’s emphasis on boosting industrial

          significantly boost the demand for industrial fluids. As the
          manufacturing base expands, sectors such as power and energy, mining
          and metals, textiles, and cement are experiencing strong growth.
          <br /> <br />
          Consequently, our industrial segment achieved double-digit growth in
          FY24, supported by new business development initiatives. The growing
          industrial segment will drive consumption of industrial and hydraulic
