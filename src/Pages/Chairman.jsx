          It is a great honour to
          address you for the first
          time as Chairman of
          Veritas Finance. Stepping
          into this role at such
          a defining moment in
          the company’s journey
          is both a privilege
          and a responsibility,
          I deeply value.

          I am pleased to share that this Annual
          Report 2024-25 marks a year of strong
          progress and the beginning of an
          important new chapter as we prepare
          to enter the public markets and expand
          the Company’s footprint across India’s
          underserved financial landscape. I take
          this opportunity to reflect on the values
          that define us, the opportunities that lie
          ahead and the collective commitment
          that will guide us forward.

          <div><p className="mb-2">
            At Veritas, our Mission is to make a
            difference and create a positive impact
            in the lives of informal customers of
            MSMEs through sustainable financing
            solutions. Our Vision is to aspire to
            establish Veritas as a model Company,
            respected and most admired in the
            field of inclusive finance, recognised
            for fairness, responsibility and service
            quality. These principles have guided
            us since our inception in 2015, helping
            us serve communities often overlooked
            by traditional financial institutions.
            Over the past decade, we have built a
            wide distribution network across ten
            states and union territory, providing
            small loans, home loans and vehicle
            loans, among others.
            <br />
            <br />
            FY 2025 has seen us reinforce these
            values by expanding our reach across
            rural and semi-urban India, tailoring
            products to meet local enterprise needs
            and building trust-based relationships
            at the grassroots level. We have
            successfully impacted the lives of around
            2,11,000 people and are seeking to bridge
            the demand/supply gap even further.
            This alignment between our Mission and
            our execution will continue to be our
            greatest strength.</p>

            Despite global macroeconomic
            uncertainties, the Indian economy
            maintained its momentum, and so did
            we. As of March 31, 2025, our loan book
            stood at INR 7,349 crores, supported by huge disbursements and a growing
            customer base of entrepreneurs,
            consciously promoted and served by us
            in view of their huge potential to serve
            the broader economy. We expanded
            our physical presence across over 10
            states and 1 union territory, powered by
            a purpose and passion-driven, strong
            employee base that is committed
            to our mission.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our profitability has remained robust, with
            Profit After Tax reaching INR 295 crores,
            while asset quality and compliance
            standards have only improved. This
            performance reflects the strategic and
            operational maturity Veritas has achieved
            over the past ten years.</p>

            and Growth Outlook</h1>
          <div><p className="mb-2">
            As we look ahead, we see the NBFC
            sector entering a phase of greater
            responsibility and sharper focus on the
            growth of the economy, with the NBFCs
            playing a definitive role in meeting the
            credit demands in the economy. With
            deeper credit penetration, stronger
            regulatory frameworks and more
            sophisticated risk and technology
            practices emerging across the industry,
            the opportunity for Veritas has never
            been more promising. The MSME
            financing space, in particular, stands at
            the cusp of huge growth and expansion
            as this market segment continues to
            be grossly underserved, and far from
            saturation, yet full of potential and
            promise. This dichotomous challenge
            is well recognised by Veritas, which the
            Company will seek to address through
            a clarity of purpose, strategic vision and
            consistency in execution.
            <br />
            <br />
            As an organization, we remain deeply
            committed to fostering gender diversity
            and inclusivity – both within Veritas
            and across the communities we serve.
            We believe that empowering women
            and underrepresented groups is vital
            to driving sustained inclusive economic
            progress. While as at March 31, 2025,
            women borrowers hold around 14 % of
            our total loan portfolio, our ‘Dhanasakthi’ loan product launched exclusively for
            women in November 2023, stands as
            a fitting testament to this commitment.
            Since its roll-out, more than 2,000
            deserving women entrepreneurs
            have been granted Working Capital
            facilities enabling them to gain financial
            independence and build resilient
            businesses. In parallel, we are also
            increasingly focused on embedding
            climate-conscious practices into our
            operations and lending approach. As
            we look ahead, green lending and
            environmentally responsible financing
            will be integral to our strategy as we align
            growth with sustainability and resilience.
            <br />
            <br />
            At Veritas, we are building for the
            long term. Our strategic priorities are
            anchored in achieving the right balance
            between scale and control, growth
            and governance, and innovation and
            stability. We are focused on broadening
            our product portfolio, deepening our
            distribution reach, and strengthening
            our institutional capabilities in a way that
            allows us to stay agile in a dynamic and
            ever-evolving environment. We are also
            in the process of formalising our ESG
            roadmap, as we believe sustainability
            and stakeholder accountability will
            increasingly define the success of
            financial institutions in the years to come.

              serves the aspirations of real India.
