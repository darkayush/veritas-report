          Dear Stakeholders,
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          The IMF’s recent baseline forecast (World Economic Outlook April 2024)
          shows that the global economy will continue to grow at 3.2% during
          2024 and 2025, at the same pace as in 2023. A very minimal
          acceleration from advanced economies will be offset by a modest
          slowdown in emerging markets and developing economies. In such a
          global backdrop, India shines as a bright spot and continues to be
          among the world’s fastest growing major economies, with a robust GDP
          growth projection of 6-8% in the coming years. India is now the third
          largest automotive and lubricant-consuming market. Not only is India
          an enormous and growing market, but also stable governance,
          unprecedented growth in infrastructure investments, and changing
          consumer demographics and aspirations are creating further potential
          for volume and value growth in the lubricants sectors. <br />
          <br /> Interestingly, the proportion of the middle class has more than
          doubled in the last 20 years and is forecasted to continue to grow
          well into the future. We can expect these aspiring consumers to
          transform consumption patterns, with an increased demand for
          high-quality products, brands and services. However, when it comes to
          vehicle ownership, it is still very low in India. Only approximately
          8% of families own a car, while 47% of households own a two-wheeler,
          which means there is significant scope for growth in the automotive
          lubricants industry. <br />
          <br /> India is also investing significantly in the future. It has
          long been a service market, but now it is becoming a manufacturing
          hub. To support this transition, central and state governments are
          investing in infrastructure as a priority, with 1.7 trillion dollars
          expected in the next four to five years. There are also exciting
          targets for expansion in rail networks, airports and in improving
          connectivity to the ports. There are impressive prospects for
          manufacturing, power and energy, along with high-growth sectors with
          service support such as mining, metals, textile and cement. This will
          positively impact the growth of the lubricants sector, especially
          within the industrial segment, driving significant advancements.
          <br />
          <br /> Competition is intensifying, prompting brands to increasingly
          appoint brand ambassadors. Your Company is operating in the most
          promising geography, with the right products and solutions, and
          targeting the most high-potential sectors for continued stakeholder’s
          value maximisation.

          Outperforming the Industry, Crossing New Milestones
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          In FY 2023-24, Gulf Oil has accomplished significant growth, setting
          high standards for the industry as a whole in a challenging market
          landscape. We have recorded the highest-ever annual revenue and profit
          for FY 2023-24. Drawing confidence from our overall performance and
          cash flow generation, the board has declared a total dividend for FY
          2023-24 at ₹36.00 per equity share. The critical business levers for
          our year-on-year higher level of financial growth include gradually
          expanding margins, prudent cost management, improved product mix,
          robust cashflows, better-working capital management and relentless
          premiumisation of our products.

          At Gulf Oil, we continue to empower communities through various

          Bandhan campaign has entered its 5th season in FY2023-24 and
          distributed over 10,000 portable water purifiers to truck drivers and
          installed community water purifiers at 12 Transportnagars across
          India. <br />
          <br />
          The campaign also launched the Gulf Superfleet Suraksha Clinic,
          providing truckers with free doctor consultations, discounts on
          medicines and health check-ups. Additionally, our projects such as
