     As I sit to write the
letter for this year,
I reflect on the
journey of Veritas
since inception. It
has been exciting 10
years. Ten years of
growth. Ten years
of transformation.
Ten years of impact.
Ten years of making
a difference. Ten
years filled with
purpose and passion

In 2015, Veritas was merely an idea. An
idea to make a positive impact in million
households in Rural India. An idea that
has found acceptance with marquee
investors. An idea that has already
impacted over 200000 customers.
An idea that is now shared by over
8000 employees.
</p>
<p className="mb-2">
Guided by our eminent board, supported
by marquee investors and lenders, Veritas
over the last ten years has meticulously
and methodically given shape to the
vision and reached out to more than
438 branches across ten states. Today,
Veritas serves the financial needs of
diversified segments. With products like
rural business loans, affordable housing
loans, used commercial vehicle loans and
working capital loans, we cover a wide
range of rural India’s financial needs.
While our Annual Report may reflect
our growth in numbers, it may not fully
capture the obstacles and headwinds we
faced along the way. It is our prudence,
perseverance, concern for our customers,
and care for our employees that helped
us overcome all the adversities and
uncertainties. We chose to place faith
over fear, conviction over scepticism.
Thus, in the face of adversity, we have
remained resilient, constantly adapting
to the ever-changing environment while
continuing to pursue our journey unfazed.

Dear Shareholders,
During this decade, India’s economy
also remained resilient with steady GDP
growth, despite the impact of various
macro events like demonetization, GST
implementation, Liquidity crisis, COVID
black swan crisis etc. Not only it remained
resilient, the Government’s thrust on
building a robust digital infrastructure
has fast tracked the financial inclusion
initiatives. This landscape offers NBFCs
like ours, particularly those serving
micro and small enterprises, a unique
opportunity to bridge credit gaps faster
and foster grassroots entrepreneurship.

<h1 className='text-xl text-[#c9243f] mb-2'>Operational and Financial Highlights</h1>
<div>
  <div className="mb-3">
      <p className="mb-2">
After witnessing reasonably strong and
vibrant growth post COVID, the macro
environment remained subdued during
the last year. The year which started with
elections and geopolitical disruptions
continued to be suppressed right
through. While we did see some signs of
stability in the last quarter, we are yet to
see definitive signals of the strong revival
of the economy.
</p>
<p className="mb-2">
Despite a difficult environment, I am
happy to convey that your company has
delivered a strong and broad-based
performance across key operational and
financial indicators. Our Loan book grew
by 28.39% to INR 7,349 Crores, driven
by disbursements of INR 3,933 Crores,
a 6.23% increase from the previous
year. We reported a Profit After Tax
(PAT) of INR 292 Crores, up from INR
245 Crores in FY 2023-24, reflecting
both scale and efficiency gains. Our
customer base expanded to 2.11 lakhs, a
significant increase from 1.76 lakhs last
year, highlighting our growing relevance
among microenterprise borrowers.
</p>
<p className="mb-2">
  While our secured business loan and
affordable housing loan segment
continued to show resilient portfolio
behaviour, we witnessed stress in certain
urban pockets of short-term working
capital loans. Some cash starved urban
shopkeepers fell prey to the easy
availability of digital loans at significantly
higher rate of interest and found it difficult
to service the loans and overcome
the stress. This had an impact on our
repayments as well. Following this, we
have made certain major changes to the
product offering and are confident that
we will see a significant turnaround in this
segment in the coming months.
</p>
<p className="mb-2">
  I am also delighted to report that used
commercial vehicle loans completed one
full year of operations and continued to
grow at a steady pace and crossed Loan
book of INR 300 Crores at the end of
March 25. We see a huge opportunity in
this segment and the experience of the
team, and the distribution reach we have
established will help us build a strong
portfolio in coming months.

   As we complete our 10th year and
enter the 11th, we also realise that we
are very close to reaching a significant
milestone of INR 10,000 Crores
Loan book. All our products are on a
strong growth trajectory, and we are
committed to building a robust and
diversified company, admired for its
values, resilience and contribution to
India’s economy.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-2">
   Our growth strategy remains anchored
in five strategic pillars: expanding in
underpenetrated markets with controlled
geographic focus; diversifying our
portfolio through scalable offerings like
affordable Housing Loans and used
commercial vehicle loans; investing in
people through a value-driven culture;
embedding technology and dataled processes across origination and
collections to boost productivity; and
forging strong partnerships to optimize
our funding mix. These priorities reflect

and ESG Commitment</h1>
  <p className="mb-2">
   At Veritas, we view social responsibility
as integral to our purpose of inclusive
growth. In FY 2024-25, we introduced
“Swastha” master health check-up
camps, conducted financial literacy
sessions for rural borrowers, and
undertook employee-led wellness
programs like the Walkathon Challenge
and Veritas Premier League (VPL).
Through Veritas Foundation, we also
supported infrastructure development
by building and maintaining smart
public toilets at the Tiruchirappalli bus
terminal. Our education efforts included
renovation of Government High School at
Ladapuram, and providing scholarships
to 42 deserving female students from
underprivileged backgrounds, across
Tamil Nadu, empowering them to pursue
higher education in fields of their choice.
Looking ahead, ESG will remain pivotal
to our strategy. Our ESG journey will
evolve through collaboration, learning,
and continuous improvement. We are
in the process of initiating a formal
ESG materiality assessment to identify
and embed sustainability priorities into
our strategy. In the months ahead, we
will define clear ESG goals, engage
with stakeholders, and build internal
capacity to measure and report our
progress effectively. This dual focus, on
measurable social impact and long-term
environmental stewardship, underscores
our commitment to building a responsible
and resilient financial institution.

  I am grateful to our employees, Board,
