          Dear Stakeholders,
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          It gives me immense pleasure to share with you our Annual Report for
          FY 2023-24. The year gone by was truly a landmark year for us, a
          period marked by continuous growth and evolution. <br /> <br />
          Notwithstanding several challenges, we have maintained our growth
          momentum and have been growing 2-3x of the industry volume growth rate
          over the last decade. We take pride in being positioned as a leading
          brand in India and strongly believe it is now time for us to unlock
          the next level of growth and value creation in an ever-evolving
          industry landscape.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[#10357f] font-bold text-left text-xl pt-4 ">
          Continued Growth Momentum
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          Our robust financials, marked by the highest-ever annual revenue and
          profitability for FY 2023-24, are a testament to our success. Our
          resilient business model, strong brand reputation, extensive
          distribution network, and passion for excellence have empowered us to
          outperform even in a challenging market.
          <br /> <br />
          For FY 2023-24, our revenue reached ₹3,284.10 crore, reflecting a
          9.50% year-on-year growth. Our EBITDA surged by 22.33% year-on-year to
          ₹419.38 crore, while our Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at ₹308.10
          crore, demonstrating an impressive 33% growth. This growth is
          indicative of our strategic initiatives and market responsiveness.
          During this financial year, we gained market share across both B2B and
          B2C segments, expanding our distribution network and launching
          innovative, value-driven products. Our targeted B2C sales and
          marketing initiatives significant boosted growth in commercial vehicle
          oils (CVO), motorcycle oils (MCO), and the agricultural sector. Our
          robust brand identity is strengthened through associations with
          esteemed brand ambassadors like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Hardik Pandya,
          and Smriti Mandhana. These efforts underscore our relentless drive for
          performance and adaptability to evolving market dynamics, setting new
          industry standards as consumers increasingly prioritise value.
          <br /> <br />
          Our B2B growth is driven by significant advancements in manufacturing
          and infrastructure across various sectors, adding marquee customers,
          built on a foundation of service, trust, and strong partnerships. At
          Gulf, we are confident this segment is poised to thrive as India
          invests heavily in its future. While our primary market is domestic,
          we also export Gulf and OEM-branded products to over 25 countries.
          <br /> <br />
          We are dedicated to expanding our eco-friendly products, having
          pioneered the AdBlue® range in India. This automotive-grade urea
          solution, designed for diesel engines with emission control systems,
          has seen 65% volume growth in FY24, positioning us as a leading
          AdBlue® supplier through strategic partnerships with multiple OEMs and
          leveraging our distribution network. With the implementation of BS VI
          emission standards, AdBlue® has rapidly emerged as a significant
          segment in the market complementing to our strength in the commercial
          vehicle oil leveraging our brand equity, quality and responsive
          distribution.

          Key Business Strategies and Unlock 2.0 for a Future-ready Approach
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          As a growing organisation, our strategy is built on six pillars: a
          segment-wise approach, brand strength, technology and innovation,
          nurturing and growing OEM and B2B relationships, passion for
          excellence and focus on expanding within the e-Mobility value chain.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          To unlock the next level of growth and success, our three-pronged
          strategy focuses on enhancing our core lubricants business,
          premiumising our portfolio, and transforming operations through a
          digital-centric culture and investment in e-Mobility value chain.

          Lubricants to Continue as Key Focus Segment
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          As we advance to the next level of growth, our primary focus is on
          strategic, sustainable, and profitable expansion in our core
          lubricants business. According to Kline & Co., the Indian lubricants
          industry is projected to achieve 3% volume and 6% value growth CAGR
          from 2022 to 2032, despite decarbonisation efforts. Factors such as
          resilient GDP growth, manufacturing development, increased vehicle
          penetration and a growing middle class will further sustain India’s
          growth momentum, ensuring it remains a bright spot for the coming
          years and positioning us to capitalise on opportunities for long-term
          success across our diverse portfolio.

        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          Over the last decade and a half, we have successfully adopted a
          segment-wise focus based on our ‘Right to Win’ approach. We
          continuously add new segments, sub-segments, and attractive focus
          areas, while exploring Core, New, Allied, and Future business
          segments.
          <br /> <br />
          We focus on forming dedicated teams for each segment to capitalise on
          opportunities, increase market share, and expand our customer base. At
          the core of our leadership philosophy is a commitment to empowerment,
          transparency in communication, and long-term consistency of our
          strategic levers. By nurturing an environment where employees feel
          valued and motivated, we drive our growth and reach new heights of
          success year after year.

          Powering Up Our Brand Strength
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          Over the past 14-15 years, the Gulf brand has thrived through
          aggressive brand-building efforts, becoming the fastest-growing
          lubricants brand in India and securing a top-two position among
          private sector players in key segments. Our dynamic marketing
          strategies have effectively reached end consumers, retailers, and
          mechanics, driving significant growth. Our brand presence is further
          enhanced with major campaigns such as Formula SUV campaign, Agri –
          360˚ campaign, CVO campaign, Gulf Pride 2-Wheeler campaign in
          partnership with celebrated ambassadors like Mahendra Singh Dhoni,
          Hardik Pandya, and Smriti Mandhana. <br /> <br />
          This IPL T-20 season, we prioritised our customers in the Gulf
          Unstoppable Army campaign, empowering fans to create their own
          advertisements for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Our efforts to
          enhance brand equity are centred on creating memorable experiences
          that elevate customer satisfaction, driving our mission to be the
          preferred choice in the lubricants market.

          Charged Up and Ready for the Next
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          We are actively expanding our presence in the e-Mobility ecosystem by
          establishing a comprehensive range of e-Mobility products, including
          specialised EV fluids designed for hybrid and electric vehicles to
          optimise performance and reduce CO2 emissions. <br /> <br />
          In recent years, we made three strategic acquisitions—Indra
          Renewables, ElectreeFi, and Tirex Transmission —to build a complete EV
          charging portfolio. We are well positioned to capitalise in this
          segment of e-Mobility making them a meaningful contributor to our
          overall business in coming years. <br /> <br />
          Additionally, we are looking at data centre liquid cooling
          opportunities, targeting significant environmental benefits. We are
          future-ready and charged up for the next level of growth and long-term
          value creation.

          Together We’re Unstoppable
        </h3>

        <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] text-left text-xl pt-4 mb-8">
          Our core strategy is to continue outperforming the industry, growing at 2-3 times the industry volume growth rate. Simultaneously, we aim to gain market share, offer value products, focus on premiumisation, gradually expand margins, and grow the e-Mobility business with our investments in the EV charging space. Together, we have reached many milestones, and I am confident that our collective efforts will empower us to unlock Gulf Oil 2.0 and co-create value for all stakeholders. <br /> <br />
          Before I conclude, I must convey my gratitude to our esteemed Chairman, fellow Board members, Gulf Oil International, the Hinduja Group, esteemed customers, employees, trade channel partners, investors, bankers, brand ambassadors, partners, agencies, and all other internal and external stakeholders for their encouragement and support in our journey.
