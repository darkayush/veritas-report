                India stands out as a vibrant segment in the global lubricants market, poised
                for significant demand growth for better quality products. Despite ongoing decarbonisation efforts, the industry is expected to grow at a value CAGR of 6% with product premiumisation over the next decade.* Given the projected growth
                in the value of the lubricants market in India outpacing volume growth in both consumer and B2B segments, we are aligned to focus on premium offerings. As the market expands, customers are increasingly seeking higher-quality products that offer better performance and longer lifespans.

                The replacement of older BS III and BS IV engines with newer BS VI models
                is creating demand for higher-quality lubricants. Additionally, the growing preference for SUVs is increasing the demand for more premium lubricants. Stringent emission norms are further propelling the growth of premium oils, while the rising use of lighter viscosity and synthetic oils contributes to overall value growth positioning the lubricants market for continued value expansion and innovation.
